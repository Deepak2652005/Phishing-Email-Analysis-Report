Phishing Email Analysis Report (Methodology-Based)

This report presents a detailed analysis of a phishing email that impersonated the sender address service@paypal.com, a common tactic used by attackers to deceive recipients into believing the email is from a legitimate source. The primary objective of this analysis is to highlight how domain spoofing, poor security configurations, and psychological manipulation techniques are used to exploit users.

The investigation began by closely examining the senderâ€™s email address. Although it appeared to be from service@paypal.com, further inspection revealed that the actual domain used was paypal-accounts.com, which is not an official PayPal domain. Legitimate PayPal emails originate from domains like @paypal.com or @paypal.service.com. This discrepancy indicated a spoofed domain.

To validate the suspicion, the spoofed domain (paypal-accounts.com) was analyzed using MXToolbox, an online tool for examining domain configurations and email security protocols. The results showed several critical red flags:

    No DMARC record was found, which means the domain lacks protection against unauthorized use.

    No valid MX (Mail Exchange) records, indicating the domain isn't set up to properly send or receive emails.

    SPF (Sender Policy Framework) misconfigurations and the absence of a quarantine/reject policy, allowing malicious actors to send emails from the domain without restriction.

    DNS issues like an invalid SOA serial number and an improper expire value further pointed to a hastily or poorly configured domain.

Beyond technical analysis, the content of the phishing email itself was examined. It employed social engineering tactics by creating a false sense of urgency, prompting the recipient to click a malicious link and reset their password. The message contained grammatical errors and unnatural language, which are typical signs of phishing attempts designed to evade automated filters but still confuse human readers.

This analysis demonstrates how attackers leverage weak domain security and psychological manipulation to launch phishing campaigns. Identifying such threats requires a combination of email header inspection, domain authentication checks, and content analysis, all of which are detailed in this report.
